  <p>Originally identified as a genetic element required for faithful partitioning of low-copy-number plasmids, the parABS system is a broadly conserved molecular mechanism for plasmid partitioning and chromosome segregation in bacteria. It consists of three components: the ParA ATPase, the ParB DNA-binding protein, and the cis-acting parS sequence. The parA and parB genes are typically found in the same operon, with parS elements located within or adjacent to this operon. Collectively, these components function to ensure accurate partitioning of plasmids or whole chromosomes between bacterial daughter cells prior to cell division.</p>
  <p>The majority of the people around Sankhabhanga are illiterate.[2] While none of the children are Catholic, five of the teaching staff are including three Jesuits.[4] The Jesuits' aim is to include a community college and vocational school at the 26 acre campus on the outskirts of Baripada.[5]</p>
